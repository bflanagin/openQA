= Quick Install

Install os-autoinst before installing openQA: https://github.com/system76/os-autoinst

Create a system76 user account, and add him to the adm and sudo groups. 

cd ./openQA

sudo ./tools/pop-install.sh

reboot

cd /var/lib/openqa/

sudo -u system76 ./script/load_templates /tests/pop/products/templates

Place latest ISOs in /var/lib/openqa/factory/iso/

== Ensure you have the latest needles

cd /var/lib/openqa/tests/pop/

git checkout branch default_install  

== Test installation

/var/lib/openqa/script/openqa-cli api -X POST isos ISO=pop-os_20.04_amd64_intel_32.iso DISTRI=pop FLAVOR=DVD VERSION=20.04 BUILD=32 ARCH=x86_64

== Troubleshooting

If the test above fails to start (stuck in scheduled) run `sudo systemctl start openqa-scheduler` and `sudo systemctl start openqa-worker@2`

if the test above fails during the test but before qemu starts check the log for permission errors.

openQA is a testing framework that allows you to test GUI applications on one
hand and bootloader and kernel on the other. In both cases, it is difficult to
script tests and verify the output. Output can be a popup window or it can be
an error in early boot even before init is executed.

Therefore openQA runs virtual machines and closely monitors their state and
runs tests on them.

The testing framework can be divided in two parts. The one that is hosted in
this repository contains the web frontend and management logic (test
scheduling, management, high-level API, ...)

The other part that you need to run openQA is the OS-autoinst test engine that
is hosted in a separate https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst[repository].

== Getting started

The project's information is organized into four basic documents. As a first
step, read the link:docs/GettingStarted.asciidoc[Starter Guide] and then, if
needed, proceed to the link:docs/Installing.asciidoc[Installation Guide].

For users of the openQA web interface or the REST API consult
link:docs/UsersGuide.asciidoc[Users Guide].

If you are interested in writing tests using openQA read the
link:docs/WritingTests.asciidoc[Tests Developer Guide].

== Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to openQA itself, check the
link:docs/Contributing.asciidoc[Developer Guide], write your code and send a
pull request ;-)

=== Issue trackers and support
:openqav3: https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3[openQAv3 project]

Our main issue tracker is at {openqav3} in openSUSE's project management
tool. This Redmine instance is used to coordinate the main development
effort organizing the existing issues (bugs and desired features) into
'target versions'.

Find contact details and meet developers over
http://open.qa/contact/[our contact page].

== Releases

openQA is developed on a continuous base where every commit in the git master
branch is considered stable and a valid and installable version. The old tags
on github are therefore misleading.
